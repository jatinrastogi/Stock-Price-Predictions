<h1 align='center'>  Stock Price Predictions  </h1>

<p> In this repo, we will work with historical data about the stock prices of a publicly listed company. We will implement a mix of machine learning algorithms to predict the future stock price of this company, starting with simple algorithms like averaging and linear regression, and then move on to advanced techniques like Auto ARIMA and LSTM. </p>
